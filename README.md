# An experimental study on upper limb position invariant EMG signal classification
An experimental study on upper limb position invariant EMG signal classification using various machine learning models such as Linear regression, logistic regression, SVM, SGD etc.This paper is focused on the man-machine interfaces for proper controlling of prosthtic devices with multiple degrees of freedom.This is a research project I have done under Prof. Suman Samui.
